# Inquizo - Interactive Quiz Web App

Inquizo is a React-based single-page application that presents users with a timed, multiple-choice quiz. It offers a dynamic and engaging user experience by incorporating interactive question navigation, instant feedback, a visual progress tracker, and a final score summary with celebratory effects like confetti.

Users start with a welcome screen, progress through multiple questions with a countdown timer, receive immediate visual feedback on each answer, and see a final result page that highlights their performance. The quiz is fully restartable and designed with clean, responsive UI.

🧪 How It Works:

1) Start the quiz from the welcome screen.

2) Each question displays with 4 options and a 30-second timer.

3) Users select an answer; correct or incorrect feedback is shown.

4) After all questions, the result screen shows the score and performance message.

5) Confetti is shown for scores above 50%.

6) Users can restart the quiz anytime.
